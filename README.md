pMagMod: A collection of data and mathematical models of paleomagnetic field variability

## Summary

This is a work-in-progress repository for mathematical stochastic models of paleomagnetic field variability. It aims to:
 - Provide easy access to access to published paleomagnetic time-series records,
 - Access to published mathematical models of paleomagnetic time-series variability, including:
   - Stochastic models of variability,
   - Deterministic models of variability,
 - Provides an interface to integrate models and recover pathwise and ensemble statistics.

### Terminology Clarification

As paleomagnetic records are simplified representations of reality, and typically the result of an inversion process, they are strictly "models." However in this repository, we will refer to them as "data," as they are acted upon to construct mathematical models of field variability. In this sense, we consifer "data" as "an object that performs the role of data", rather than an explicit signifier.

Similarly we consider "models of paleomagnetic field variability" to be mathematical models: ordinary differential equations, stochastic differential equations, or other dynamical systems. We emphasize that these are models of *variability*, providing a strictly statistical representation of the paleomagnetic field, and not a pathwise description.
